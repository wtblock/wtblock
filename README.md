William T. Block III

I am a retired computer programmer that started my career on S100 bus computers in the 1970s and progressed to MSDOS in the early 1980s which eventually led to programming Windows 1.0 in the late 1980s. The move to Windows was a seachange to my career because I was able to participate in Windows development from the very beginning of a very exciting time in the evolution of computer science.

My full resume is located here: http://www.wtblock.com/resume/ 

After retiring I have spent time curating family photographs which led to the projects published on Github because over many decades of photography, there are numerous issues with the date taken metadata. The programs on this site are simple command line programs to address these issues.
